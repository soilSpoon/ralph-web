# Exclude Playwright tests from bun test runner
# bun test by default looks for .test.ts, .spec.ts, etc.
# We want to exclude the tests/ directory which contains Playwright e2e specs.
# Note: As of now bunfig.toml might not fully support exclude patterns for test runner in all versions,
# but we will rely on package.json scripts to enforce this as well.
